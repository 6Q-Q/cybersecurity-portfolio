# Cybersecurity Portfolio - DONG YICHEN
My cybersecurity professional portfolio

## 1. About Me
My name is **DONG YICHEN**, and I am currently a postgraduate student specializing in cybersecurity. I became interested in this field when I realized how much our daily lives depend on digital systems and how vulnerable these systems can be if they are not properly protected.  

I am at the early stage of my cybersecurity journey, but I am highly motivated to build a solid foundation in network security, system hardening, and ethical hacking. This portfolio documents my growth, the projects I work on, and the skills I am developing as I move towards a professional career in cybersecurity.

## 4. Project Experience

### Project 1: Internal Network Scanning and Basic Hardening
- **Objective**: To understand how attackers discover services on a network and to practice basic defensive measures.  
- **Tools**: Nmap, Linux terminal  
- **Methodology**:  
  - Set up a small virtual network environment using virtual machines.  
  - Performed host discovery and port scanning using Nmap ( `-sS` and `-sV` options) to identify active hosts and exposed services.  
  - Reviewed the scan results to determine which services were unnecessary or misconfigured.  
  - Applied basic hardening measures, such as disabling unused services and adjusting firewall rules.
- **Outcome**:  
  - Gained hands-on experience in interpreting Nmap scan results.  
  - Learned how simple configuration changes can reduce the attack surface of a system.  
  - Developed a better understanding of how attackers might approach network reconnaissance.

### Project 2: Packet Capture and Traffic Analysis with Wireshark
- **Objective**: To build familiarity with network traffic patterns and practice identifying interesting or unusual packets.  
- **Tools**: Wireshark, Linux/Windows host  
- **Methodology**:  
  - Captured traffic from common activities such as web browsing and DNS lookups.  
  - Used Wireshark filters ( `http`, `dns`, `tcp.port == 80`) to focus on specific types of traffic.  
  - Examined packet headers to understand source/destination IPs, ports, and protocols used.  
  - Compared normal browsing traffic with simple simulated suspicious behavior (e.g., repeated connection attempts to the same port).
- **Outcome**:  
  - Learned how to navigate Wireshark, apply filters, and follow TCP streams.  
  - Improved understanding of how data moves across a network and how certain patterns may indicate potential issues.  
  - Built a foundation for future work in intrusion detection and incident analysis.

### Project 3: Simple Python Script for Log Processing (Learning Project)
- **Objective**: To use Python to process basic log-like data and become more comfortable with scripting for security tasks.  
- **Tools**: Python, Jupyter Notebook or VS Code  
- **Methodology**:  
  - Created a small sample log file containing simulated login attempts.  
  - Wrote a Python script to count failed login attempts from the same IP address and highlight suspicious patterns.  
  - Printed summary statistics, such as the most frequent IP addresses and number of failed attempts.
- **Outcome**:  
  - Understood how Python can be used to automate repetitive security-related analysis.  
  - Strengthened basic programming skills that will be useful for future cybersecurity projects.

## 5. Learning Journey

### What I Have Learned So Far
Since starting this course, I have gained a clearer picture of how cybersecurity fits into the broader IT environment. Some key learnings include:
- The importance of the CIA Triad and how it guides security decisions.  
- How basic network components (routers, switches, firewalls) and protocols work together.  
- How tools like Nmap and Wireshark can reveal valuable information about network behavior.  

These experiences have helped me move from a theoretical understanding of security to performing simple, practical tasks in a controlled environment.

### Challenges I Am Facing
Although I have made progress, there are still several areas that I find challenging:
- **Command-line proficiency**: I am not yet comfortable with more complex Linux commands, scripting, and automation.  
- **Cryptography**: While I understand basic concepts, I find it difficult to fully grasp how different cryptographic algorithms are applied in real systems.  
- **Incident response and logs**: Interpreting large amounts of log data and understanding how to respond to incidents is still new and sometimes overwhelming.

### How I Plan to Improve
To address these challenges, I have set several personal goals:
- Spend regular time practicing Linux commands and basic bash scripting to build confidence with the terminal.  
- Follow structured online courses and reading materials on cryptography, starting from the fundamentals and moving gradually to more advanced topics.  
- Practice analyzing small sets of logs using Python or built-in tools, slowly increasing complexity as I become more comfortable.  
- Participate in beginner-level Capture The Flag (CTF) challenges and guided labs to apply theoretical knowledge to practical scenarios.

## 6. Career Objective

My long-term goal is to develop into a cybersecurity professional who can help organizations identify and reduce security risks in a proactive way. At this stage, I am still exploring specific roles, but I am particularly interested in the following areas:
- **Security Analyst / SOC Analyst**: Monitoring systems, analyzing alerts, and responding to security events.  
- **Penetration Testing (in the future)**: Ethically testing systems and applications to discover vulnerabilities before attackers do.

### Short-Term Objectives
- Build a stronger foundation in networking, Linux, and common security tools.  
- Become comfortable with reading and writing basic scripts in Python to assist with security tasks.  
- Complete all course assignments to a professional standard and maintain this GitHub portfolio as evidence of my progress.

### Long-Term Objectives
- Earn an entry-level cybersecurity certification to validate my skills.  
- Gradually move towards more advanced roles, such as penetration testing or security engineering, after gaining enough experience.  
- Contribute back to the cybersecurity community by sharing learning notes, tools, or write-ups once I reach a more advanced level.
